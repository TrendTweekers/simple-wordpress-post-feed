# Telegram Alerts — WP Simple Feed

Real-time Telegram notifications for key lifecycle events.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Token from @BotFather |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Chat/channel ID to send messages to |

If either variable is unset, all notifications are silently skipped — the app continues normally.

Set these in Railway under **Variables** (or in `.env` locally).

## How to test each alert manually

### Install
Uninstall the app from a dev store, then reinstall. The OAuth flow will trigger afterAuth.

### Trial Started
Same as install — `initShop` fires as part of the install flow.

### Trial Activated / Paid Conversion
Send a test webhook from Shopify Partners dashboard:
**Partners → App → Webhooks → Send test notification → app_subscriptions/update**
Or use curl:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-railway-url.com/webhooks/billing \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Shopify-Shop-Domain: test.myshopify.com" \
  -H "X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256: <valid_hmac>" \
  -d '{"app_subscription":{"status":"ACTIVE","trial_days":7}}'
```

### Uninstall
Uninstall the app from a test store. Shopify sends the webhook to `/swpf/uninstall`.

### Critical Error
Temporarily break the Firebase credentials in Railway env vars, trigger an install, then restore them.

### Daily Summary
Temporarily change the cron schedule to fire 1 minute from now, deploy, wait, then restore:
```js
cron.schedule("* * * * *", async () => { ... }); // every minute
```
